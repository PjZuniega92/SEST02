    <h1>ACTIVITY 1: Grade Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      In this activity, the user is prompted to enter a score. Based on the
      score entered, the code uses conditional statements (if, else if, and
      else) to determine the corresponding grade.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the score is 90 or above, it assigns the grade 'A'.</li>
      <li>If the score is between 80 and 89, it assigns the grade 'B'.</li>
      <li>If the score is between 70 and 79, it assigns the grade 'C'.</li>
      <li>If the score is between 60 and 69, it assigns the grade 'D'.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the score is below 60, it assigns the grade 'F'.</li>
      <li>The grade is then printed to the console.</li>
    </ul>
